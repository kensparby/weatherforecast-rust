# Weather Forecast

Prints the next 6 hours of weather in icon form, as a single string.<br>
Uses the [Location Forecast 2.0 API](https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/documentation) from Met.no<br>
I use this as a module for Polybar.

Uses the [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons) in my case, but substitute your favorite icon set by changing them in the source.

Disclaimer: I do not know what I'm doing in Rust.
