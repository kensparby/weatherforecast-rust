# Weather Forecast

Prints the next 6 hours of weather in icon form, as a single string.

I use this as a module for Polybar.

Uses the [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons) in my case, but substitute your favorite icon set by changing them in the source.

Disclaimer: I do not know what I'm doing in Rust.
