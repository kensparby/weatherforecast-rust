# Weather Forecast

<p>Tiny program I use as a module in Polybar to display the next 6 hours of weather in icon form.</p>
<p>Uses the [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) in my case, but substitute your favorite icon set by changing them in the source.</p>

Disclaimer: I do not know what I'm doing in Rust.
